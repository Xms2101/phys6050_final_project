Using the open data product from the MINERvA Collaboration, this code goes through the minervame1P playlists and unfolds the muon energy spectrum via Bayesian unfolding in PyUnfold. snip.py is used to cut down from the several thousand branches in each data and Monte Carlo file to just the few dozen used in the unfolding process. muon_unfold.py reads these snipped files and works them through selecting the right events, creating a response matrix, calculating efficiencies, unfolding, and creating useful plots. The search was conducted for coherent pion+ production events.

This project was conducted in November and December of 2025 by Xavier M. Stiles at Columbia University for their final project in PHYS 6050 Particle Phenomenology with Professor Karagiorgi.
